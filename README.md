## Smart Lead Scoring Engine: Identify the potential leads for a D2C startup

Description: <br/> 

A D2C startup develops products using cutting edge technologies like Web 3.0. Over the past few months, the company has started multiple marketing campaigns offline and digital both. As a result, the users have started showing interest in the product on the website. These users with intent to buy product(s) are generally known as leads (Potential Customers). <br /> <br />

Leads are captured in 2 ways - Directly and Indirectly. <br /> <br />

Direct leads are captured via forms embedded in the website while indirect leads are captured based on certain activity of a user on the platform such as time spent on the website, number of user sessions, etc. <br /> <br />

The marketing & sales team wants to identify the leads who are more likely to buy the product so that the sales team can manage their bandwidth efficiently by targeting these potential leads and increase the sales in a shorter span of time. <br /> <br />

We have following columns in the dataset, <br />

id : Unique identifier of a lead <br />

created_at : Date of lead dropped <br />

signup_date: Sign up date of the user on the website <br />

campaign_var (1 and 2) : campaign information of the lead <br />

products_purchased : No. of past products purchased at the time of dropping the lead <br />

useractivityvar (1 to 12): Derived activities of the user on the website <br />

buy: 0 or 1 indicating if the user will buy the product in next 3 months or not <br /> <br />


Task at hand : To predict the customer's propensity to buy a product based on the user's past activities and user level information.
